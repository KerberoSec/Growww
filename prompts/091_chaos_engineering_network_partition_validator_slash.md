# 091 - Chaos Engineering, Network Partition & Validator Slash Simulation

## Purpose
Prove platform unshakeability under catastrophic infrastructure failures by subjecting the entire exchange, consensus validators, and matching engines to automated continuous chaos experiments.

This document establishes the authoritative technical blueprint, mathematical models, state machines, API interfaces, failure recovery mechanisms, and regulatory compliance mapping for Chaos Engineering, Network Partition & Validator Slash Simulation across the Growww / NBSE platform.

## What You Are Building
A continuous chaos engineering orchestration suite built on Chaos Mesh and LitmusChaos that injects network latency, terminates matching engine pods, partitions Kafka brokers, and simulates validator consensus stalls.

Key capabilities include:
- Scalable, low-latency microservice architecture designed for high-concurrency 24/7 financial operations.
- Deterministic state machine governing all resource lifecycles with absolute transactional consistency.
- Comprehensive gRPC service interfaces and schema definitions ensuring clean polyglot service boundaries.
- Resilient failover, automated circuit breakers, and zero-loss disaster recovery mechanisms.

## Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope:**
- Automated weekly chaos injection pipelines running in pre-production staging and testnet clusters.
- Validator consensus partition simulation: drops 1 of 4 Besu validators to verify unbroken QBFT block production.
- Matching engine pod termination under 10,000 req/sec load verifying sub-500ms failover to Raft standby.
- Kafka broker network partition simulation verifying zero message loss and automatic partition leader re-election.
- **Out of Scope / Handled Elsewhere:**
- Live production user fund adjustments.
- Regulatory license revocation.

## Technology to Use
- Core Technologies: Chaos Mesh, LitmusChaos, Go chaos runner, Prometheus chaos metrics exporter, Grafana Resilience Dashboard.
- Performance Standards: Sub-millisecond internal processing, microsecond-precision OpenTelemetry tracing.
- Data Integrity: ACID relational persistence, distributed Redis caching, and immutable ledger anchoring.

## Backend / Infra Touchpoints
- Site Reliability Engineering Stack, Kubernetes EKS Clusters, Besu Consortium Nodes, Kafka Cluster, CI/CD Pipeline.

## Blockchain Interaction
Validates that Hyperledger Besu QBFT consensus maintains liveness and safety during network split-brain scenarios.

- **Consensus & Block Finality:** Hyperledger Besu QBFT consensus with 2-second block intervals and deterministic finality.
- **Security Invariant:** Anchored to Hyperledger Besu QBFT permissioned ledger with HSM key management and zero on-chain PII.

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions
1. Review system architectural boundaries and regulatory invariants for Chaos Engineering, Network Partition & Validator Slash Simulation.
2. Define the core domain entities, data models, and state lifecycle transitions for Chaos Engineering, Network Partition & Validator Slash Simulation.
3. Establish the primary microservice boundaries, gRPC service definitions, and Protobuf contracts.
4. Design high-performance state transitions, in-memory caches, and database schemas ensuring sub-millisecond execution.
5. Configure the Hyperledger Besu blockchain interface, smart contract interactions, and deterministic event listeners.
6. Implement robust pre-execution validation checks, balance reservations, and anti-tamper security controls.
7. Connect distributed telemetry, OpenTelemetry microsecond tracing, and Prometheus metrics for real-time observability.
8. Establish fallback mechanisms, dead-letter queues, and graceful degradation paths for upstream/downstream service failures.
9. Implement automated reconciliation loops verifying off-chain state consistency against immutable on-chain records.
10. Construct comprehensive unit, integration, and fuzz testing suites achieving >90% code branch coverage.
11. Perform end-to-end chaos engineering and stress test simulations under 10,000 requests per second burst load.
12. Review security posture with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and obtain regulatory compliance sign-off.

## Failure Modes & Edge Cases
| Failure Scenario | Trigger Condition | System Behavior & Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network Partition / Disconnection | Distributed nodes or external feeds lose connectivity | Automated circuit breaker trips; requests queue with exponential backoff; fallback to secondary failover nodes within 500ms. |
| Invalid Signature / Payload Tampering | Malformed or spoofed cryptographic payload submitted | Immediate rejection with gRPC code INVALID_ARGUMENT; client IP flagged in rate limiter; security event logged to WORM audit trail. |
| Replay Attack Attempt | Attacker re-submits previously executed transaction or signature | Monotonic nonce check rejects duplicate; Redis nonce lock prevents race conditions; transaction dropped silently after alert dispatch. |
| High Latency / Upstream Timeout | Upstream service or blockchain node exceeds latency budget | Execution falls back to cached state if safe, or returns DEADLINE_EXCEEDED; client prompted to retry with idempotent token. |
| State Desynchronization | In-memory cache diverges from database or on-chain truth | Periodic reconciliation job detects hash mismatch; locks affected resource; performs deterministic state rollback from immutable WAL. |
| Hardware / Memory Exhaustion | Pod memory or CPU reaches 90% threshold under burst traffic | Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales replicas; non-critical telemetry sampled; rate-limiting shedder rejects low-priority requests. |
| Blockchain Re-org or Stall | Consensus node halt or unexpected transaction delay | Transaction status stays PENDING; automated gas escalator increases replacement fee; alert triggered if block generation exceeds 6 seconds. |
| Unhandled Edge Discrepancy | Corner-case market condition or arithmetic overflow occurs | Safe transaction abort; all balance locks released immediately; full core dump captured for deterministic offline replay. |
