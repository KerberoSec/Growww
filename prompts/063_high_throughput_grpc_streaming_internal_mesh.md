# 063 - High-Throughput gRPC Streaming for Internal Microservices

## Purpose
Ensure high-throughput, low-latency, and strictly typed inter-service communication across all 79 backend microservices by standardizing internal RPC and streaming on gRPC and Protocol Buffers v3.

This document establishes the authoritative technical blueprint, mathematical models, state machines, API interfaces, failure recovery mechanisms, and regulatory compliance mapping for High-Throughput gRPC Streaming for Internal Microservices across the Growww / NBSE platform.

## What You Are Building
A microservice communication standard and shared gRPC transport layer featuring bidirectional streaming, connection pooling, client-side load balancing, automatic mTLS encryption, and distributed OpenTelemetry context propagation.

Key capabilities include:
- Scalable, low-latency microservice architecture designed for high-concurrency 24/7 financial operations.
- Deterministic state machine governing all resource lifecycles with absolute transactional consistency.
- Comprehensive gRPC service interfaces and schema definitions ensuring clean polyglot service boundaries.
- Resilient failover, automated circuit breakers, and zero-loss disaster recovery mechanisms.

## Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope:**
- Bidirectional gRPC streaming for orderbook feed replication and matching engine event distribution.
- Strict Protobuf v3 schemas across all packages with automated backward-compatibility linting (buf).
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) with SPIFFE/SPIRE dynamic certificate rotation across all internal pod-to-pod channels.
- Interceptors for distributed tracing (traceparent propagation), request deadline enforcement, and error normalization.
- **Out of Scope / Handled Elsewhere:**
- Public REST documentation.
- Browser client rendering.

## Technology to Use
- Core Technologies: gRPC Go / gRPC Rust, Protocol Buffers v3, buf CLI, Envoy service mesh, OpenTelemetry interceptors.
- Performance Standards: Sub-millisecond internal processing, microsecond-precision OpenTelemetry tracing.
- Data Integrity: ACID relational persistence, distributed Redis caching, and immutable ledger anchoring.

## Backend / Infra Touchpoints
- All 79 microservices in services/, packages/proto schemas, Kubernetes CoreDNS, Istio / Envoy Mesh.

## Blockchain Interaction
Transmits batch trade settlement hashes from matching engine to Hyperledger Besu relayer daemon via secure gRPC stream.

- **Consensus & Block Finality:** Hyperledger Besu QBFT consensus with 2-second block intervals and deterministic finality.
- **Security Invariant:** Anchored to Hyperledger Besu QBFT permissioned ledger with HSM key management and zero on-chain PII.

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions
1. Review system architectural boundaries and regulatory invariants for High-Throughput gRPC Streaming for Internal Microservices.
2. Define the core domain entities, data models, and state lifecycle transitions for High-Throughput gRPC Streaming for Internal Microservices.
3. Establish the primary microservice boundaries, gRPC service definitions, and Protobuf contracts.
4. Design high-performance state transitions, in-memory caches, and database schemas ensuring sub-millisecond execution.
5. Configure the Hyperledger Besu blockchain interface, smart contract interactions, and deterministic event listeners.
6. Implement robust pre-execution validation checks, balance reservations, and anti-tamper security controls.
7. Connect distributed telemetry, OpenTelemetry microsecond tracing, and Prometheus metrics for real-time observability.
8. Establish fallback mechanisms, dead-letter queues, and graceful degradation paths for upstream/downstream service failures.
9. Implement automated reconciliation loops verifying off-chain state consistency against immutable on-chain records.
10. Construct comprehensive unit, integration, and fuzz testing suites achieving >90% code branch coverage.
11. Perform end-to-end chaos engineering and stress test simulations under 10,000 requests per second burst load.
12. Review security posture with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and obtain regulatory compliance sign-off.

## Interfaces / Contracts
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package growww.mesh.v1;

option go_package = "growww/packages/proto/growww/mesh/v1;meshv1";

message RouteInternalMessageRequest {
  string request_id = 1;
  string user_id = 2;
  string symbol = 3;
  uint64 amount_e8 = 4;
  uint64 price_e8 = 5;
  uint64 timestamp_ms = 6;
  map<string, string> metadata = 7;
}

message RouteInternalMessageResponse {
  string request_id = 1;
  bool success = 2;
  string execution_id = 3;
  string transaction_hash = 4;
  uint64 block_number = 5;
  string error_message = 6;
  int64 processed_at_ms = 7;
}

message RouteInternalMessageEvent {
  string event_id = 1;
  string aggregate_id = 2;
  string event_type = 3;
  bytes payload = 4;
  uint64 sequence_number = 5;
  uint64 timestamp_ms = 6;
}

service InternalMeshService {
  rpc RouteInternalMessage(RouteInternalMessageRequest) returns (RouteInternalMessageResponse);
}
```

## Failure Modes & Edge Cases
| Failure Scenario | Trigger Condition | System Behavior & Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network Partition / Disconnection | Distributed nodes or external feeds lose connectivity | Automated circuit breaker trips; requests queue with exponential backoff; fallback to secondary failover nodes within 500ms. |
| Invalid Signature / Payload Tampering | Malformed or spoofed cryptographic payload submitted | Immediate rejection with gRPC code INVALID_ARGUMENT; client IP flagged in rate limiter; security event logged to WORM audit trail. |
| Replay Attack Attempt | Attacker re-submits previously executed transaction or signature | Monotonic nonce check rejects duplicate; Redis nonce lock prevents race conditions; transaction dropped silently after alert dispatch. |
| High Latency / Upstream Timeout | Upstream service or blockchain node exceeds latency budget | Execution falls back to cached state if safe, or returns DEADLINE_EXCEEDED; client prompted to retry with idempotent token. |
| State Desynchronization | In-memory cache diverges from database or on-chain truth | Periodic reconciliation job detects hash mismatch; locks affected resource; performs deterministic state rollback from immutable WAL. |
| Hardware / Memory Exhaustion | Pod memory or CPU reaches 90% threshold under burst traffic | Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales replicas; non-critical telemetry sampled; rate-limiting shedder rejects low-priority requests. |
| Blockchain Re-org or Stall | Consensus node halt or unexpected transaction delay | Transaction status stays PENDING; automated gas escalator increases replacement fee; alert triggered if block generation exceeds 6 seconds. |
| Unhandled Edge Discrepancy | Corner-case market condition or arithmetic overflow occurs | Safe transaction abort; all balance locks released immediately; full core dump captured for deterministic offline replay. |
